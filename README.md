# Axioms of TLA+ for SMT

Documentation for the axiomatization of TLA+'s non-temporal fragment (in `tlaplus`), and the axioms used in the SMT encoding of TLAPS (in `smtlib`).  Axioms for SMT also feature E-matching patterns, also known as "triggers".

The reference for TLA+ is the book _Specifying Systems_, which you can find at https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html.  TLA+'s semantics is not originally presented in the form of a set of axioms, but I believe the presentation offered here is equivalent to that of the reference book.

Just run `make` for generating the pdfs.
